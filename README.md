# Images from the car and it's remote controller
This project involves the development of a remote-controlled car equipped with a gyro sensor to allow movement based on the motion of the controller. The communication between the STM32 microcontrollers on the car and the remote controller is established using the TCP protocol, implemented via the ESP8266 module. The STM32 microcontrollers handle both the car's movement and the remote's input, ensuring real-time control and reliable data exchange.
